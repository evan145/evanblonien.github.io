# Why I started this blog

I want to share some of the projects that I have done over the last couple of months and this is a better way to share/explain in addition to github. In this blog, I want to: 

1. Share my projects
2. Explain the new things I've learned 
3. Connect with others to get feedback 

# What is next? 

In the upcoming posts I will be covering: 

- How to use fasthml 
- How to combine fasthtml with API calls 
- How to use RAG
