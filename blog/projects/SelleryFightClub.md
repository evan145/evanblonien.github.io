# Introduction 
Here is the Sellery Fight Club film App

# Description
This project is a movie database for sellery residents that allows them to have a private repo for searching, saving, and planning movies on the 10th floor

Functions: 
1. Search for a specific movie
2. Browse the most popular movies 
3. Save and schedule movies
   
# How it works
This project works by getting an API call from an open source webiste called TMDB. The API call gets all of the information about a movie such as the cast list, desciption, title, and more. Then with this data, FastHTML is used to create a locally run webpage that displays the information as a website.
