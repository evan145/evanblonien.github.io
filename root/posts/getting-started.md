# Getting Started with my blod

Welcome! This is my **first blog post** and I am excited to share my posts with you. This blog will be a place where I document by learning journey and share what I learn. 

## What to expect

Here are some topics that I plan to cover: 
- Python
- Fasthtml
- API Calls
  
`python print("Hello, World!") def greet(name): print(f"Hello, {name}!")`
